### Idea:

Companies nowadays like to shorten their domains using a suffix present inside their brand names. Like for example instead of, let‚Äôs say wisebot.com, how about wise.bot or wiseb.ot? Clever right? Makes it short and memorable. Instead of a 5 second manual labor, let my ingenious creation do it for you!

### How it‚Äôll work:

- User enters a domain name
- Algorithm scans from last letter to the first
- Compares it to a huge database of domains to find possible match to replace the suffix
- Outputs the results as a list ~~with pricing and availability and a direct link to buy it~~

### Pros:

- Saves you 5 seconds of mental hard work

### Cons:

- Nobody is autistic enough to not figure it out themselves
