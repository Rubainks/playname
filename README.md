### Idea:

Companies nowadays like to shorten their domains using a suffix present inside their brand names. Like for example instead of, let‚Äôs say wisebot.com, how about wise.bot or wiseb.ot? Clever right? Makes it short and memorable. Instead of a 5 second manual labor, let my ingenious creation do it for you!

### How it‚Äôll work:

- User enters a domain name
- Algorithm scans from last letter to the first
- Compares it to a huge database of domains to find possible match to replace the suffix
- Outputs the results as a list

### Problems I faced:
- UI was suppose to be like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/811925266740936704/1099057188351262790/playname.png). But I'm my utter dogshit CSS skills didn't allow me to make that so I had to use a [library](https://picocss.com/).
- Along with the list, it was suppose to display the pricing, availability and a direct link to buy. No clue how to do it.
